My name is Michael Anthony Borchardt.
I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and programmer from Yakima, Washington.

Foremost, this Github account is to store personal work that demonstrates my competency as a programmer. Consider this a portfolio page, of sorts, if you will.

I began programming with the C language in 2010. I have expanded to using a few different languages since then. 

I have experience writing client and server side code for business-grade web applications. Furthermore, I also have experience with web application security testing. 

I have a fundamental understanding of constructing secure network infrastructure. While I don't have a degree in Information Technology, I have quality understanding of how information security works. 

Also, I have experience with penetration testing web applications. 

As of currently, I am working on being better with writing code in assembly, information security best practices, web application security, and web application development.
