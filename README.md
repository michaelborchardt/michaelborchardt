My name is Michael Anthony Borchardt.

Foremost, this Github account is to store personal work that demonstrates my competency as a programmer. Consider this a portfolio page, of sorts, if you will.

I began programming with the C language in 2010. I have expanded to using a few different languages since then. 

I have experience writing client and server-side code for business-grade web applications. Furthermore, I also have experience with web application security testing. 

Currently, I am working on being better at writing code in assembly.
